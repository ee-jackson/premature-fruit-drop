\section{Introduction}

Conservation of biodiversity is essential for the maintenance of ecosystem services and ultimately, human survival (\cite{randsBiodiversityConservationChallenges2010, chanConservationPlanningEcosystem2006}). Tropical forests are widely regarded as a conservation priority as they are home to much of the Earths’ biodiversity (\cite{brooksGlobalBiodiversityConservation2006}). This includes approximately two thirds of the planet’s plant species, with high numbers of different species found at small spatial scales (\cite{wilsonBiodiversity1988}). For example, 473 different tree species can be found within a single hectare in the Amazon (\cite{valenciaHighTreeAlphadiversity1994, deoliveiraCentralAmazonianTerra1999}), whereas the northern hemisphere temperate forests are reported to support only 1,166 tree species combined (\cite{lathamContinentalComparisonsTemperatezone1993}, also see \cite{rickettsWhoWhereNorth1999, glenn-lewinSpeciesDiversityNorth1977}). Trees, and plants more generally, are key structural elements of terrestrial ecosystems and are the basis of all terrestrial food webs, with plant species richness correlating with overall organismal diversity (\cite{saubererSurrogateTaxaBiodiversity2004, duelliSearchBestCorrelates1998}). The high local species richness in tropical forests poses a challenge to general ecological theory, where competition for resources limits local alpha diversity through competitive exclusion. Understanding what controls the number of species in one area and what allows so many species of trees to coexist in tropical forests, is one of the core questions in community ecology. Answering this, will aid in predicting the future of biodiversity and identifying effective methods for its conservation. \\

Many non-mutually exclusive mechanisms have been suggested to prevent competitive exclusion and promote high alpha diversity (\cite{palmerVariationSpeciesRichness1994, wrightPlantDiversityTropical2002}).The Janzen-Connell hypothesis (\cite{connellRoleNaturalEnemies1971, janzenHerbivoresNumberTree1970}), proposes that coexistence is achieved through the role of specialist plant enemies, which reduce recruitment close to reproductive adults of the same species and in areas of high conspecific density, providing space for other species (Figure \ref{JC}). This would result in density- and distance- dependent patterns of plant mortality, enhancing diversity (e.g. \cite{forristerHerbivoresDriversNegative2019, bagchiPathogensInsectHerbivores2014}). Since its proposal, the hypothesis has received much attention, with many studies finding support for its predictions (e.g. \cite{harmsPervasiveDensitydependentRecruitment2000, hubbellPresenceAbsenceDensity1990, connellCompensatoryRecruitmentGrowth1984, manganNegativePlantSoil2010}), including a recent meta-analysis (\cite{comitaTestingPredictionsJanzenConnell2014}). \\

\small{Janzen and Connell independently hypothesised that the observations of high local alpha diversity in tropical forests could be partly explained by patterns resulting from two processes (\cite{connellRoleNaturalEnemies1971, janzenHerbivoresNumberTree1970}). (1) The number of seeds reaching any given point decreases with distance from the parent plant. (2) There is an increased rate of predation by host-specific natural enemies where prey are abundant. These two processes result in a population recruitment curve (PRC) that peaks where probability of recruitment into the population is highest – a point that is some distance away from the parent plant. As a result, the space immediately surrounding an individual is more likely to be colonised by seeds of different plant species, despite more of the plant’s own seeds falling in that area. 

Here, the upper panel is adapted from figure 1 in \cite{janzenHerbivoresNumberTree1970} and shows the effect of post-dispersal enemies on the PRC – this is what the majority of studies on the role of enemies in tropical forests have examined. The lower panel is adapted from figure 2 in \cite{janzenHerbivoresNumberTree1970}, and shows what happens when pre-dispersal enemies reduce the seed crop. It seems plausible that the seed dispersal curve will change, as represented by the red line. The effect on the PRC is not known but will depend on how the altered seed or seedling distributions affect recruitment in the longer term. In this hypothetical example, the PRC is shifted closer to the mother tree, a pattern that would in fact imply that pre-dispersal seed predators would reduce diversity.}
\end{framed}


Whilst Janzen’s 1970 paper highlighted that mortality at any stage of the plant life cycle, from developing seed to recruitment, could have implications for diversity (\cite{janzenHerbivoresNumberTree1970}), the literature overwhelmingly focuses on enemies attacking seeds post-dispersal. Pre-dispersal enemies, which cause mortality to the seed whilst still attached to the parent plant, have also been found to influence the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of their host (\cite{kolbEcologicalEvolutionaryConsequences2007}). Internally feeding insect seed predators in particular, may be important for maintaining plant diversity in tropical forests. They have high levels of host specificity, which is a prerequisite for the Janzen–Connell mechanism to contribute to diversity maintenance (\cite{sedioHowSpecialisedMust2013, stumpDistanceresponsivePredationNot2015}). These insects typically feed on one or a few closely related species during their larval stage and tend to be more specialized than other insect herbivores (\cite{novotnyHostSpecificityInsect2005}). Recent work on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, found only 20\% of insect seed predator species feeding on more than one host plant species (\cite{gripenbergHighlyResolvedFood2019}), making them interesting candidates to study in the context of plant diversity maintenance. \\

This project will use a combination of approaches to investigate the role of an understudied group of plant enemies (pre-dispersal insect seed predators) in promoting the coexistence of plant species in a tropical forest. We will test if patterns of pre-dispersal seed mortality follow key predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, furthering our understanding of the mechanisms maintaining tropical hyper-diversity. \\* My thesis, split into seven sections, will be structured as follows: \\

\textbf{General introduction} \\*
    Overview of the literature and context of the project.\\*
    
\textbf{Chapter1: Community-level patterns of premature fruit abscission in tropical forest plants} \\*
    Trees often abscise a portion of their seeds prematurely, but this phenomenon – and its potential implications for plant diversity maintenance – has not been studied in tropical forests. I will use an available data set of fruit drop for ~270 woody plant species collected in a Panamanian forest (Barro Colorado Island) over a 30-year period to quantify interspecific variation in in premature fruit abscission rates. I will also investigate to what extent this variation can be explained by plant phylogeny and selected plant traits. Additionally, I will use published data documenting the network of tropic interactions between tropical plants and their insect seed predators (\cite{gripenbergHighlyResolvedFood2019}), to test whether premature fruit abscission rates are higher in plant species known to be attacked by pre-dispersal insect seed predators, as would be predicted if these enemies trigger some premature fruit abscission.\\*

\textbf{Chapter 2: Intra-specific patterns of premature fruit abscission in tropical forest plants} \\*
    The Janzen-Connell hypothesis for species coexistence in tropical forests predicts that seed mortality due to natural enemies will be highest closest to adult plants of the same species and in areas of high conspecific density. If insect seed predators or other specialist pre-dispersal seed enemies contribute to immature fruit abscission, we might therefore expect fruit abscission rates to be highest in parts of the forest where the density of conspecific tree individuals is highest. Using the same dataset as in the previous chapter I will, for a few species for which a sufficiently large amount of data are available, assess spatial and temporal patterns of premature fruit abscission. This will enable me to test Janzen’s prediction of landscape-level density dependence in seed predation at the intraspecific level.\\*

\textbf{Chapter 3: Pre-dispersal seed predators and seed production}\\*
    The extent to which insect seed predators (and other enemies attacking developing seeds and fruits in the canopy) suppress the reproductive output of trees is unknown. I will conduct manipulative field experiments, which exclude insect seed predators from individuals of selected tree species. By comparing the number of healthy seeds produced on treated trees compared to control trees, I can quantify seed mortality caused by pre-dispersal enemies and test whether insect seed predators are in fact suppressing the reproductive output of tropical forest plants. Pre-dispersal seed predators can be excluded using insecticides (\cite{ loudaLimitationRecruitmentShrub1982}) or bagging (\cite{ nakagawaPredispersalSeedPredation2005}). Because of restrictions on manipulative work at my main field site (Barro Colorado Island), the experiments will take place in nearby Panamanian forests with a similar species composition. For logistical reasons, the experiments will focus on selected understorey species and/or canopy species that can be accessed from the two research canopy cranes operated by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. In this way we can assess the effects of pre-dispersal seed predator exclusion on seed dispersal kernels and seedling recruitment curves, as in (\cite{ janzenHerbivoresNumberTree1970}), and determine how this influences plant diversity. The results will provide some of the first experimental data on pre-dispersal seed mortality inflicted by insects, and will also be used for parameterising the model(s) in Chapter 5.\\*
    
\textbf{Chapter 4: Spatial variation in seed predator attack}\\*
    If pre-dispersal seed enemies contribute to the maintenance of plant diversity through density-dependent patterns of attack, we would expect individual trees isolated from conspecifics to experience lower levels of seed predation than individuals growing close to members of their own species. This prediction has rarely been tested (but see \cite{jonesDensitydependentPredispersalSeed2010}). Using mapped forest plots of Barro Colorado Island, Panama, I will – for selected tree species – identify individuals that differ in their degree of isolation from reproductive-sized conspecifics. There may also be an opportunity to access tree maps based on drone-generated aerial surveys. I will conduct surveys quantifying the level of insect seed predation for these trees, allowing me to assess spatial variation in attack by pre-dispersal enemies. \\*

\textbf{Chapter 5: Pre-dispersal seed predators and plant species coexistence}\\*
    Excluding pre-dispersal seed enemies from an entire forest to assess the effects on local tree diversity would be logistically unfeasible. To investigate the community-level effects of pre-dispersal seed predation, I will therefore use a modelling approach, in which I simulate tree populations at the landscape level. I will explore the possibility of modifying existing Individual Based Models (IBMs) targeting the plant community of BCI (e.g. \cite{leviTropicalForestsCan2019, usinowiczTemporalCoexistenceMechanisms2017, usinowiczCoexistenceTropicalForests2012, caplatEffectsDisturbanceFrequency2009}). This would enable me to explore what happens to the tree community of BCI (in terms of diversity) under different levels of pre-dispersal seed predation.\\*

\textbf{General Discussion}\\*
    Discussion regarding findings and insights from all chapters in light of one another.\\*

Collectively, these chapters will contribute to answering the question of if, and how, pre-dispersal seed enemies contribute to Janzen-Connell effects and the maintenance of tropical plant diversity.
