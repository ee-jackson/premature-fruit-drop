  abstract = {Tropical trees can provide various ecological services to adjacent agricultural environments, including maintaining and amplifying the numbers of beneficial insects. In Mexico, certain tree species harbor a diverse guild of hymenopteran parasitoids that attack pest fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) and are at the same time sources of valuable hardwood timber. Indigenous trees and their associated fauna are slowly disappearing due to forest clearance and the expansion of crop monocultures. Here we explore the relationship among pest and non-pest fruit flies, their fruit-hosts and parasitoids in the context of mango orchards and surrounding patches of uncultivated vegetation and propose a novel mechanism to use these associations in favor of conservation purposes and pest management. Trees of conservation biological control interest are classified as: (1) parasitoid multiplier plants, species that serve as alternate hosts for key fruit fly pests when their commercial hosts are not available, but in which they are unusually vulnerable to parasitism; (2) parasitoid reservoir plants, native or introduced trees in whose fruits non-pest fruit flies serve as hosts to generalist parasitoids that are able to attack pest tephritids in other species of commercially grown fruit; and (3) pest-based parasitoid reservoir plants, native or introduced species that are not economically important locally, but which harbor fruit flies that would be pests in other circumstances and that serve as hosts for parasitoids of the important pests in the vicinity. Protection, multiplication and dissemination of such tree species has the potential to increase the number of naturally produced fruit fly parasitoids and could assist in the management of tephritid pests in areas where destruction of forests has impoverished the historical sources of fruit fly natural enemies. Tropical forest conservation may help resource-poor farmers reduce crop losses, increase biodiversity within fruit-growing regions and conserve native forests for both conservation purposes and commercial use of native hardwoods.},

  abstract = {1. Niche theory proposes that species differences underlie both coexistence within communities and the differentiation in species composition among communities via limiting similarity and environmental filtering. However, it has been difficult to extend niche theory to species-rich communities because of the empirical challenge of quantifying niches for many species. This has motivated the development of functional and phylogeny-based approaches in community ecology, which represent two different means of approximating niche attributes. 2. Here, we assess the utility of plant functional traits and phylogenetic relationships in predicting community assembly processes using the largest trait and phylogenetic data base to date for any set of species-rich communities. 3. We measured 17 functional traits for all 4672 individuals of 668 tree species co-occurring in nine tropical rain forest plots in French Guiana. Trait variation was summarized into two ordination axes that reflect species niche overlap. 4. We also generated a dated molecular phylogenetic tree based on DNA sequencing of two plastid loci (rbcL and matK) comprising 97\% of the individuals and 91\% of the species in the plots. 5. We found that, on average, co-occurring species had greater functional and, to a lesser extent, phylogenetic similarity than expected by chance. 6. We also found that functional traits and their ordination loadings showed significant, albeit weak, phylogenetic signal, suggesting that phylogenetic distance provides pertinent information on niche overlap in tropical tree communities. 7. Synthesis. We provide the most comprehensive examination to date of the relative importance of environmental filtering and limiting similarity in structuring tropical tree communities. Our results confirm that environmental filtering is the overriding influence on community assembly in these species-rich systems.},

  abstract = {The importance of vertebrates, invertebrates, and pathogens for plant communities has long been recognized, but their absolute and relative importance in early recruitment of multiple coexisting tropical plant species has not been quantified. Further, little is known about the relationship of fruit traits to seed mortality due to natural enemies in tropical plants. To investigate the influences of vertebrates, invertebrates, and pathogens on reproduction of seven canopy plant species varying in fruit traits, we quantified reductions in fruit development and seed germination due to vertebrates, invertebrates, and fungal pathogens through experimental removal of these enemies using canopy exclosures, insecticide, and fungicide, respectively. We also measured morphological fruit traits hypothesized to mediate interactions of plants with natural enemies of seeds. Vertebrates, invertebrates, and fungi differentially affected predispersal seed mortality depending on the plant species. Fruit morphology explained some variation among species; species with larger fruit and less physical protection surrounding seeds exhibited greater negative effects of fungi on fruit development and germination and experienced reduced seed survival integrated over fruit development and germination in response to vertebrates. Within species, variation in seed size also contributed to variation in natural enemy effects on seed viability. Further, seedling growth was higher for seeds that developed in vertebrate exclosures for Anacardium excelsum and under the fungicide treatment for Castilla elastica, suggesting that predispersal effects of natural enemies may carry through to the seedling stage. This is the first experimental test of the relative effects of vertebrates, invertebrates, and pathogens on seed survival in the canopy. This study motivates further investigation to determine the generality of our results for plant communities. If there is strong variation in natural enemy attack among species related to differences in fruit morphology, then quantification of fruit traits will aid in predicting the outcomes of interactions between plants and their natural enemies. This is particularly important in tropical forests, where high species diversity makes it logistically impossible to study every plant life history stage of every species.},

Physalis plants (Solanaceae) abscise fruit containing feeding larvae of their main frugivore, Heliothis subflexa Guenee (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a specialist moth. We tested the ability of H. subflexa larvae placed under the plant canopy to find and climb onto two architecturally different Physalis species. Physalis pubescens L., a low, shrub-like, spreading plant, abscises its fruit at a higher rate than Physalis angulata L., a tall arborescent plant. As a result, small larvae are more often dropped from P. pubescens. Third and fifth instars located P. pubescens faster and with a higher probability than P. angulata. Although fifth instars outperformed third-instar caterpillars at finding P. angulata, P. pubescens was located equally fast by the two instars. Heliothis subflexa located Physalis plants more successfully and more quickly than a close relative, the generalist Heliothis virescens Fabricius. The higher fruit abscission rates in P. pubescens may be an evolved response to its greater susceptibility to searching caterpillars.},

  abstract = {Tree squirrels (Tamiasciurus) are important selective agents on conifer reproductive strategies (Smith 1970, 1975). Although this is well established for wind-dispersed pines, the impact of tree squirrels on bird-dispersed pines has been largely ignored. I assessed the impact of tree squirrels on the allocation of reproductive energy in the bird-dispersed limber pine (Pinus flexilis) by comparing its cone and seed traits from three sites in the Rocky Mountains where tree squirrels (Tamiasciurus) are present to those from three mountain ranges in the Great Basin where tree squirrels are absent. As predicted, differences between the two regions in individual cone and seed traits are consistent with the hypothesis that tree squirrels are important selective agents on these traits. In the absence of tree squirrels, limber pine allocates more than twice as much energy to kernel compared with that invested in putative seed defenses (cone, resin, and seed coat) as does limber pine where tree squirrels are present. Such a large difference is particularly striking, because tree squirrels may have become extinct in the Great Basin in only the last 12,000 yr. Although many factors influence the allocation of energy to cones and seeds, no single factor other than the presence of tree squirrels is compatible with the large and consistent differences between limber pine in the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin. These results show that tree squirrels are an important constraint on the evolution of cone and seed traits that promote the dispersal of seeds by birds.},

  abstract = {Many studies of post-dispersal seed predation have focused on density and distance dependent mortality, while relatively few have examined the fates of isolated seeds. Yet, scatter-dispersed seeds (sensu Howe) are commonly deposited singly or in small groups. Furthermore, even in species with highly aggregated seed distributions, the fates of the most widely dispersed individuals may be critical for recruitment. We compared predation rates on single, isolated seeds, among 40 species of trees in lowland tropical rain forest at Gunung Palung, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Seeds were placed along four replicate transects and monitored for damage by predators, removal and germination in four trials, each lasting at least 30 days. Tethering of seeds did not affect removal rates, indicating that removals were attributable to seed predators and not merely to physical disturbance by animals or abiotic factors. After 30 days, mortality due to seed predation, averaged over species, was more than 50\%; among species, predation losses ranged from 0 to 100\%. Over the range of seed sizes we examined (0.1 g to 11.6 g fresh weight) predation rates were negatively associated with seed size and with the thickness and hardness of the seed coat. Lower predation on larger seeds is contrary to theoretical predictions and some prior empirical findings, and may be partially explained by the scarcity of predators capable of penetrating the physical defenses of large seeds with hard seed coats. Large, soft seeds with low predation rates may have poor nutrition or may be protected by chemical defenses. Species differed greatly in 30-day germination rates, ranging from 0 to 47\%. Some species with low predation rates also had low germination rates; the implications for the overall risk of predation during the seed stage are discussed. Predation rates were not associated with species' natural dispersal mode (clumped vs scatter-dispersed), contrary to theoretical predictions. Spiny rats (Maxomys spp.) were the most abundant seed eating rodent. Caged spiny rats avoided large, hard seeds and preferred soft, medium sized seeds. The substantial rates of post dispersal predation on isolated seeds that we measured may be sufficient to influence strongly the population dynamics and life history evolution of trees in this rain forest community.},

To address this need, biodiversity conservation organizations have proposed nine templates of global priorities over the past decade. Here, we review the concepts, methods, results, impacts, and challenges of these prioritizations of conservation practice within the theoretical irreplaceability/vulnerability framework of systematic conservation planning. Most of the templates prioritize highly irreplaceable regions; some are reactive (prioritizing high vulnerability), and others are proactive (prioritizing low vulnerability). We hope this synthesis improves understanding of these prioritization approaches and that it results in more efficient allocation of geographically flexible conservation funding.},

  abstract = {Flowering plants often produce more flowers than fruits. An initial ``excess'' of flowers, although making no numerical contribution to fruit set, may indirectly increase female reproductive success by allowing selective maturation of fruits of superior quality. I use a framework based on order statistics to assess the potential fitness benefit from this ``wider choice'' mechanism. The analysis shows that a floral surplus with subsequent selective abortion can generate large increases in mean female fitness. However, marginal fitness returns always diminished as the floral surplus increased (i.e., the fitness gain curve was always saturating), and imperfect selectivity of abortion could severely mute the advantages of surplus flowers. If the mating environment creates low variance in quality among developing fruits, then little benefit is derived from surplus flowers, while a high variance allows large fitness gains but with rapidly saturating benefits. The results imply that selection on flower number due to wider choice could be very strong in some circumstances, but that selection through this mechanism may often favor only a modest number of excess flowers.},

  abstract = {To test the premises and predictions of the Janzen-Connell model (Janzen's spacing mechanism), seeds of the rainforest canopy tree, Brosimum alicastrum, were placed at different distances from the parent tree and their removal observed over 3 weeks. The number and density of naturally occurring seeds at different distances from the parent tree were also estimated. Predation was not greater near the parent tree, except on the very small spatial scale: the proportion of experimental seeds removed was greater 1 m from the trunk than it was 5\textendash{}25 m from the trunk. Predation was negatively correlated with seed density, not positively as the Janzen-Connell model assumes-presumably due to predator satiation. The density of seeds after predation peaked 5 m from the tree trunk, but this is well within the crown radius of the parent tree. There is a peak in the number of potential recruits at a distance of 10 m from the parent tree, due to the peaked initial distribution of seeds. This peak is caused by the interaction between the seed density curve and the increasing area of an annulus around the parent tree at increasing distances, not by the product of the density curve and the predation curve. However, it is important to realize that it is not the presence of a peak in recruitment away from the parent that is essential to maintaining tropical tree species diversity, but frequency-dependent recruitment induced by poor recruitment near conspecifics. Predator satiation seems to be an important factor in the survival of B. alicastrum seeds, possibly at several spatial scales. The number of seeds produced by the tree is negatively correlated with the loss to predators, and trees that have a fruiting conspecific nearby also suffer lower levels of predation. Seed predation increases as one moves from the forest edge into the interior, creating an edge effect that may have long-term effects on the forest composition and tree species diversity. More studies are needed, for other species, other localities, and larger spatial and temporal scales, on both the Janzen-Connell mechanism and this edge effect.},

  abstract = {Biotic interactions play a critical role in mediating community responses to temporal environmental variation, but the importance of these effects relative to the direct effects of environmental change remains poorly understood, particularly in diverse forest communities. Here we combine a neighborhood modeling approach with insights from coexistence theory to assess the effects of temporal variation in species interactions and environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and understory light availability) on seedling survival over nine census years in a subtropical forest. We find significant temporal shifts in the magnitude of neighborhood effects on both community-wide and species-level seedling survival (statistically significant random effects of neighborhood x year and neighborhood x species x year interactions). These results are consistent with the idea that environmental change will play a fundamental role on forest regeneration dynamics by altering biotic interactions at the neighborhood scale. Moreover, differences among species in response to neighbors over time contribute to a pattern of temporal decoupling of seedling survival between species, which can help to promote diversity in certain contexts. In separate analyses of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), altered interactions with neighbors are much stronger predictors of asynchronous seedling survival among species than the pure effects of climate and plant functional traits, explaining twice as much variation (43.9\% vs. 22.2\%). In sum, these results reveal that divergent species responses to interannual environmental variability detected are driven primarily by indirect effects mediated by changing biotic environments. This highlights the importance of including indirect effects from local biotic (neighborhood) interactions in forecasts of forest community responses to global change.},

  abstract = {One general hypothesis to explain how forest tree diversity is maintained is that rarer species are favored over commoner species in their reproduction, growth, and/or mortality. Mechanisms acting in this way would continually compensate for the tendency of some species to increase at the expense of others, and would reduce the chance of local extinction of rare species. Two hypotheses concerning such compensatory mechanisms were tested in subtropical and tropical evergreen rain forests in Queensland, Australia. Hypothesis 1: on the scale of 1\textemdash{}2 ha, commoner species have lower rates of recruitment and growth and higher rates of mortality than do rarer ones. This hypothesis was tested using abundances either of adults or of members of the same size\textemdash{}class, and was rejected for growth and mortality and for recruitment of over\textemdash{}story species, but not rejected for recruitment in subcanopy and understory species in either forest. Hypothesis 2: the close proximity of other individuals is more deleterious (i.e., causes slower growth or higher mortality) if they are the same species than if they are different species. This hypothesis was accepted for growth or survival of nearest neighbors in several of the seedling size\textemdash{}classes in both forests. In contrast, increased densities of the same species in quadrats had no more deleterious effect on growth and survival than did increased densities of different species. At the scale of proximity to adults, hypothesis 2 predicts that young trees have higher mortality nearer conspecific adults than farther away. In both forests, 90\% of the species tested showed no such pattern of mortality of seedlings or saplings, nor was the strength or direction of the deviation from equal mortality correlated with the abundance of adults of that species. Field experiments gave the same results. In summary, tests of both hypotheses showed that some compensatory trends occurred and that these were very similar in the two forests. The mechanisms producing these compensatory trends may be attacks by natural enemies (grazers, pathogenic fungi, etc.), interference, or, less likely, competition for resources.},

A potentially important theoretical advance was the idea that seed number\textendash{}seedling survival tradeoffs could explain the coexistence of species, in particular colonization\textendash{}competition tradeoffs where smaller-seeded species are superior colonizers and larger-seeded species are superior competitors. However, recent models have placed limits on the potential of this approach, chiefly by showing that the asymmetry of competition must be strong. Also, although there is evidence from studies within functional groups that seed size does trade off against number of seeds and dispersal of those seeds, and that seed size is correlated with competitive ability among seedlings and tolerance of hazards during establishment, the available evidence suggests that SNSS tradeoffs do not make possible long-term coexistence without other forms of niche differentiation.},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal patterns and seed persistence in the soil should strongly influence the distribution of pioneer tree recruits in gaps. Nonetheless, seed distribution patterns for pioneers are poorly known, and processes controlling the fate of seeds in the soil have been little explored. We examined patterns of seed rain, seed abundance in the soil, and seed mortality of two common pioneer trees, Miconia argentea (Melastomataceae) and Cecropia insignis (Moraceae), on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. For each species, we selected four isolated, reproductive trees within a 50-ha forest dynamics plot. Seed rain and soil seed bank samples were collected, respectively, in mesh traps and from soil cores sampled along transects radiating away from the tree crowns. At below-crown sites, seed rain inputs far exceeded soil seed bank densities measured at the end of the fruiting season. For Miconia, the below-crown seed bank in the surface 3 cm of soil accounted for only 23\% of seed rain, and for Cecropia, only 2\%. However for Miconia, at distances {$>$}5 m from the crown seed bank densities exceeded the annual seed rain input. For both species log seed densities in the seed bank declined linearly with log distance from the crown and also decreased dramatically through the year. The annual loss rate of Miconia seeds was {$>$}90\% below the crown and declined to 65\% at 30 m from the crown. The annual loss rate for Cecropia was {$>$}90\% at all distances. Seed losses in the seed bank could be largely attributed to mortality from pathogenic fungi. Fungicide treatment significantly increased seed survival in the soil for both species. For these two gap-dependent pioneer species, rapid seed-bank turnover rates and logarithmic declines in soil seed density with distance from adults suggested that both the spatial distribution and timing of gap formation may have influenced their chances of successful gap colonization. Recruitment from distant seed sources, or from seeds surviving in the soil after the death of the parent tree, may be relatively rare for these species.},

  abstract = {Shading during early fruit development reduces fruit growth and initiates fruit abscission in apple (Malus x domestica). The mechanisms mediating the decline in fruit growth in response to shading are not well understood. In this study, the effects of shading during early fruit development on cell production and expansion were investigated. Additionally, the effects of shading on the expression of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism, fruit growth, and cell production and expansion were investigated to develop a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms and to identify genes that mediate the reduction in fruit growth. Shading of isolated branches or entire trees m.,15 to 18 days after full bloom resulted in a sharp decline in fruit growth by 3 days after treatment. Reduction in fruit growth was consistently mediated by a decline in cell production within 3 days after treatment. Reduced fruit growth was also associated with lower cell size by 3 to 7 days after shading in two different years. These data indicate that the reduction in fruit growth as a result of shading is mediated by a reduction in cell production and expansion. The expression of two sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) genes, MdSDH1 and MdSDH2, was higher in the shaded fruit by up to 10-fold, suggesting an increase in SDH activity to meet the immediate respiratory demands of the developing fruit. The auxin response factor (ARF), MdARF 106, displayed approximate to 3-fold higher expression in the shaded fruit, suggesting its involvement in regulating mechanisms that mediate the reduction in fruit growth. Two A2-type cyclins, MdCYCA2;2 and MdCYCA2;3, which are positively associated with cell production, displayed lower expression in the shaded fruit by up to 4.6-fold. Conversely, MdKRP4 and MdKRP5, cell cycle genes negatively associated with cell production, displayed 3.9- and 5.3-fold higher expression in the shaded fruit, respectively. Additionally, two genes associated with cell expansion, MdCOB1 (cobra1) and MdEXPA10;1 (expansin), displayed lower expression in the shaded fruit. Together, these data indicate that shading results in coordinated changes in the expression of carbohydrate metabolism-related genes, key transcription factors related to fruit growth, and genes associated with cell production and expansion. These changes may subsequently decrease the progression of the primary processes that mediate fruit growth.},

Hectare A had 285 species, 138 genera, and 47 families; hectare B 280 species, 123 genera, and 48 families; and hectare C 280 species, 125 genera, and 44 families. Comparably high species richness in Amazonia has heretofore only been reported from western Amazonia. This dispels the idea that high species richness can only develop in areas with rich soils and relatively high rainfall. It is suggested that such high species richness is the result of a combination of habitat heterogeneity and geological history. These high diversity forests, because they occur on nutrient poor soils, can be protected with little or no impact on development in the region because the soils are essentially useless for agriculture and for supporting long-term cattle pasture.},

  abstract = {Aim The relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the species diversity of temperate organisms has been debated for a long time. Here, we used drepanosiphine aphids as a model group to validate the `resource-dependent hypothesis' based on the biotic interactions for specialist herbivorous insects, a hypothesis stating that their intricate relationship with host plants for resources might constrain their species diversity from being positively correlated with the species diversity of their hosts, and to assess the role of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the global species diversity pattern of temperate organisms. Location Global and regional. Time period Current. Taxon Drepanosiphine aphids (Insecta: Hemiptera: Aphidoidea). Methods We first investigated the global species diversity pattern of drepanosiphine aphids. Then we used ordinary least squares (OLS) and spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models to conduct regression analyses to test for the relationships of global and regional species richness between drepanosiphine aphids and their host plants, and other predictor variables describing entire woody plants, environmental energy, water availability, climate seasonality, topographical heterogeneity and land cover. Finally, structural equation models (SEMs) were further used to test for direct and indirect effects of key ecological variables. Results The distribution hotspots of species richness and endemism were both located in temperate zones, supporting the notion that drepanosiphine aphids were representative of temperate organisms. The specific host plant was the most important ecological variable in explaining global and regional drepanosiphine species richness, showing a strong positive relationship. The climatic variables mainly showed an indirect effect on global and regional drepanosiphine species richness via specific hosts. Main Conclusions The global and regional drepanosiphine species richness was primarily shaped by specific host plants as opposed to all woody trees, with indirect effects of climatic factors via host plants, which supported the `resource-dependent hypothesis' based on the biotic interactions for specialist herbivorous insects. This finding sheds new light on the `biotic interactions hypothesis' that states biotic interactions can primarily affect the distributions and diversity patterns of both tropical and temperate organisms not only at the local scale but also at the regional to global scales.},

A major challenge in community ecology and evolutionary biogeography is to reveal the mechanisms underlying these differences. For herbivorous insects, one such mechanism leading to an increased number of species in a given locale could be increased ecological specialization, resulting in a greater proportion of insect species occupying narrow niches within a community. We tested this hypothesis by comparing host specialization in larval Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) at eight different New World forest sites ranging in latitude from 15 degrees S to 55 degrees N. Here we show that larval diets of tropical Lepidoptera are more specialized than those of their temperate forest counterparts: tropical species on average feed on fewer plant species, genera and families than do temperate caterpillars. This result holds true whether calculated per lepidopteran family or for a caterpillar assemblage as a whole. As a result, there is greater turnover in caterpillar species composition (greater beta diversity) between tree species in tropical faunas than in temperate faunas. We suggest that greater specialization in tropical faunas is the result of differences in trophic interactions; for example, there are more distinct plant secondary chemical profiles from one tree species to the next in tropical forests than in temperate forests as well as more diverse and chronic pressures from natural enemy communities.},

ABA indirectly reduces carbon assimilation via stomatal closure, but may also induce abscission directly through hormone action. Variable thinning of pear suggests an effect of light environment on ABA efficacy. We tested the hypothesis that combinations of ABA and shade will be additive in inducing fruit abscission if they affect different physiological processes. A two-way factorial design was used to evaluate ABA (0, 125 ppm) and shading (0, 44, 77\%) on gas exchange and fruit set of 10-year-old 'Bartlett' pear trees on OH x F 97 rootstock. Within 6 h from the application of ABA (applied at petal fall), entire canopies of treated and non-treated trees were shaded for 15 days. Single-leaf stomatal conductance (g (s)) was controlled solely by ABA, whereas photosynthesis (Pn) was regulated by ABA and shade. Under increasing shade, however, Pn inhibition was not increased by ABA. Internal CO2 of leaves was consistently highest for 77\% shade, indicating non-stomatal effects. Fruit set was significantly reduced by both ABA and shade, but a significant interaction suggested that ABA played a negligible role in abscission as shading increased. The data suggest that ABA and shading inhibited Pn by different mechanisms; shading limited light reactions and ABA reduced CO2 supply. When 125 ppm ABA was combined with high levels of shading, shading placed greater limits on Pn. Had ABA elicited a direct hormonal response to induce fruit abscission, an additive effect of ABA and shade would have been observed. Based on these data, the major role of ABA on pear thinning may be carbohydrate deficit.},

The hypotheses tested here are that the incidence of seed predation by bud-infesting insect larvae in capitula of Asteraceae is positively related to (1) capitulum size among species, (2) capitulum size within species, (3) capitulum lifespan, and (4) the degree of flowering asynchrony on individual plants. Three populations of each of 20 common herbaceous species of Asteraceae from disturbed ground and grassland habitats were monitored for the presence of pre-dispersal, seed-eating insect larvae. Mean capitulum size (receptacle width) of each species was measured. In a sub-set of eight species, individual capitula were tagged to determine their flowering phenology and lifespan (from anthesis to seed shedding). From these data an index of flowering synchrony on individual plants was derived. Among species, the incidence of larval infestation increased with capitulum size. Small-flowered species such as Achillea millefolium were largely free of bud-infesting larvae, whilst large-flowered species such as Arctium minus were heavily infested. In three cases investigated in greater detail, bud infestation was found to increase with capitulum size within species, suggesting a potential for natural selection to favour smaller capitula. No relationship was found between infestation levels and either capitulum lifespan or degree of flowering synchrony, and there was no evidence that the relationship between capitulum size and infestation was confounded by correlations with these other features. The results support hypotheses 1 and 2, but not 3 and 4. It is suggested that the characteristic capitulum size of each species may represent a trade-off between the opposing selection pressures of pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators.},

Here, we show that masting intensity is higher in species with low foliar N and P concentrations, and especially in those with imbalanced N/P ratios, and that the evolutionary history of masting behaviour has been linked to that of nutrient economy. Our results support the hypothesis that masting is stronger in species growing under limiting conditions and suggest that this reproductive behaviour might have evolved as an adaptation to nutrient limitations and imbalances. Mast seeding is a reproductive trait of some perennial plants that display synchronous, highly variable annual production of fruit. The drivers of mast seeding are not well understood. Here, the authors report a global-scale investigation of masting behaviour and reveal a link with nutrient economy.},

Flowers were collected in full anthesis with the aim to correlate a possible lack of gametophyte to early fruit drop. It has been found that about 25\% of flowers of both cultivars shows no more than 2 ovules with gametophyte. The fate of these ovaries is indeed to be shed early during fruit development. Almost 30\% of flowers shows 3-5 developed gametophytes and only 48\% of flowers contains 6 or more ovules with embryo-sac. It has also been found that king flowers have generally the highest number of ovules containing gametophyte. When the two cultivars are compared, it is seen that S. flowers shows a lower number of ovules with embryo-sac than G.D. .

We quantified the similarity of neighbors in terms of key ecological traits that mediate these interactions, as well as the similarity of herbivore communities. We show that phytochemical similarity and shared herbivore communities are associated with decreased growth and survival at the sapling stage, a key bottleneck in the life cycle of tropical trees. None of the traits associated with resource acquisition affect plant performance, indicating that competition between neighbors may not shape local tree diversity. These results suggest that herbivore pressure is the primary mechanism driving NDD at the sapling stage.},

Whether this is a maternally controlled late-acting self-incompatibility mechanism, or an expression of inbreeding depression, is difficult to determine. In either case, however, selection is expected to favor early abortion of inbred or incompatible zygotes to minimize loss of resources. In many species, this does not occur, suggesting the possibility of adaptive reasons for retaining selfed or inbred seeds that are aborted at relatively late developmental stages. We propose that such seeds serve an important function in diluting the impact of pre-dispersal seed predators by acting as seed predator sinks and thereby increasing the survival probabilities of outcrossed and fully viable seeds. We suggest that selfed seeds retained and developed through the periods of seed predator attack are effectively offered and sacrificed for the benefit of outcrossed seeds.},

  abstract = {A variety of ecological processes influence diversity and species composition in natural communities. Most of these processes, whether abiotic or biotic, differentially filter individuals from birth to death, thereby altering species' relative abundances. Nonrandom outcomes could accrue throughout ontogeny, or the processes that generate them could be particularly influential at certain stages. One long-standing paradigm in tropical forest ecology holds that patterns of relative abundance among mature trees are largely set by processes operating at the earliest life cycle stages. Several studies confirm filtering processes at some stages, but the longevity of large trees makes a rigorous comparison across size classes impossible without long-term demographic data. Here, we use one of the world's longest-running, plot-based forest dynamics projects to compare nonrandom outcomes across stage classes. We considered a cohort of 7,977 individuals in 186 species that were alive in 1971 and monitored in 13 mortality censuses over 42 y to 2013. Nonrandom mortality with respect to species identity occurred more often in the smaller rather than the larger size classes. Furthermore, observed nonrandom mortality in the smaller size classes had a diversifying influence; species richness of the survivors was up to 30\% greater than expected in the two smallest size classes, but not greater than expected in the larger size classes. These results highlight the importance of early life cycle stages in tropical forest community dynamics. More generally, they add to an accumulating body of evidence for the importance of early-stage nonrandom outcomes to community structure in marine and terrestrial environments.},

  abstract = {Absolute number of seeds lost to predispersal seed predators and proportion of total seeds lost per infructescence were compared among five Costa Rican Piper species of different annual fecundities. Mean seed number and mean seed size in the five species were negatively correlated. The impact of predation on these species was inversely related to the number of seeds they produced. The two early successional species had very high fecundities, a combination of many seeds per infructescence, many infructescences per plant, and, in one species, year-round reproduction. Although seed predators destroyed as many or more seeds of these early successional species than they did of the less fecund, late successional species, this loss accounted for a relatively minor proportion (9 and 12\%) of the seeds of the early successional species. In contrast, late successional species produced fewer, larger seeds in a smaller number of infructescences and were not continually in fruit. One of these species, which produced intermediate numbers of intermediately sized seeds, lost 30\% of the seeds in each infructescence on average. Seed predators destroyed a larger proportion (65 and 76\%) of the seeds per infructescence in the two species with fewest seeds per infructescence. High levels of insect damage in these late successional species caused many of their infructescences to abort prematurely. Taken together these factors resulted in annual fecundities several orders of magnitude smaller in shade-tolerant Piper species than the annual fecundities of shade-intolerant, early successional species. Seedlings of the two early successional species were common in large gaps and other sunny clearings and seedlings of the species with 30\% seed loss were occasional, whereas no seedlings were seen of the two species with the highest proportional seed loss, suggesting that seed predation on the latter species may limit seedling recruitment.},

Our study is based on more than 200 000 fruits representing 478 plant species, associated with 369 insect species. Insect host-specificity was remarkably high: only 20\% of seed predator species were associated with more than one plant species, while each tree species experienced seed predation from a median of two insect species. Phylogeny, but not plant traits, explained patterns of seed predator attack.

Across the 200 sites, recruit seedling diversity was significantly higher than seed diversity. Part of this difference was explained by interspecies differences in average recruitment success.

We also compared the amount of seed predation due to vertebrate and insect predators. Levels of seed predation were extremely species-specific, ranging from 20\textendash{}100 percent of seeds consumed during the 30 day study period. However, the proportion of seeds remaining was not correlated with seed size. Overall, seed mortality did not differ between the forest and open pasture habitats, but was significantly lower under isolated pasture trees. Individual species differed in which habitat they suffered the highest levels of predation. For eight of ten species studied, levels of seed predation did not vary significantly with distance from the foredpasture edge in any habitat.

We analysed sapling recruitment of a given tree species against recruitment of all other competing tree species, as a function of distance to nearest conspecific adult tree. Strong negative conspecific effects of large trees on saplings were detectable in a few very common species, but not in many others. The power to detect conspecific effects was evaluated in model tree populations in which the strength of these effects was known a priori. The measured conspecific effects appear strong enough in the densest species to prevent them from assuming complete dominance. However, many species do not show these effects, and we conclude that these effects play only a limited contributing role to the maintenance of tree species diversity in the BCI forest.},

  abstract = {The Janzen-Connell hypothesis explains the maintenance of tropical diversity through the interacting effects of parent-centered dispersal patterns and distance- and density-dependent propagule survival. These effects were thought to support regular spacing of species within tropical forest, enhancing diversity. One of the predictions of the hypothesis is that seed and seedling survival should improve with increased parental distance. Although there are many independent tests of this hypothesis for individual species, there are few synthetic studies that have brought these data together to test its validity across species. This paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of the effect of distance on enhancing propagule survival, employing an odds-ratio effect size metric. We found no general support for the distance-dependent prediction of the hypothesis, and conclude that further testing to explore this hypothesis as a diversity-maintaining mechanism is unnecessary. However, we did find that distance from parent slightly reduces survivorship in the temperate zone, as contrasted with the tropics, and we saw stronger evidence in support of the hypothesis for seedlings than for seeds. The phenomenon of enhanced propagule survival with distance from the parent may be important for the population biology of particular species, but it is not a general phenomenon across communities, life history stages or life forms.},

Previous research has largely focused on the technical aspects of seeding with little effort directed at identifying demographic processes driving recruitment failures. 2. In tilled plots, in each of 3 years, we estimated life stage transition probabilities for three species commonly used in sage steppe restoration. We also took similar measurements on seed sown by managers following four major fires. 3. Point estimates and associated Bayesian confidence intervals demonstrated germination probabilities that were consistently high, averaging 0{$\cdot$}72. However, estimates suggest only 17 and 7\% of the germinated seeds emerged in the tilled plots and fire sites, respectively. Following emergence, survival across the seedling, juvenile and adult transitions averaged 0{$\cdot$}72. This suggests the transition from a germinated seed to an emerged seedling was the major bottleneck in recruitment. Although most individuals died during emergence, this was not always the principal source of variation in recruitment across sites. 4. Synthesis and applications. Processes occurring after emergence, such as mortality during spring and summer drought, may contribute to site-to-site variation in recruitment but are unlikely to be the main causes of restoration failures. Instead, recruitment may largely be determined by processes occurring during emergence, such as freezing and thawing of the seedbed, development of physical soil crusts and pathogen attack on germinated seeds. Using tools such as seed coatings and soil amendments to manage processes inhibiting emergence and developing seed mixes with higher emergence probabilities are likely to greatly improve restoration outcomes in the sage steppe and similar aridland systems.},

Pygiopachymerus lineola oviposits on the large pods, the first\textemdash{}instar larvae bore into the seeds, and the emerging adults cut large exit holes in the pod wall. Moth larvae gain access through these holes and eat clean much of the sticky pulp around the seeds. Simultaneously, the adults of Z. interstitialis enter through the P. lineola exit holes and oviposit directly on all clean seeds. In heavily disturbed communities where vertebrate dispersal agents are absent, these host\textemdash{}specific bruchids achieve almost 100\% predation on the C. grandis seed crop; however, the more rapidly the dispersal agents remove the seed pods, the less seed predation there will be by Z. interstitialis. Since C. grandis bears mature fruit every other year, the size of each seed crop is large enough to surpass the predation abilities of the bruchids that survive the distance in time and space between seed crops. The system may be viewed as an example of predator satiation. The potential for further co\textemdash{}evolution of the bruchid\textemdash{}Cassia interaction is high, but numerous opposing forces in the selective process can be identified.},

  abstract = {Negative density-dependent demographic processes operating at post-dispersal seed, seedling, and juvenile stages are the dominant explanation for the coexistence of high numbers of tree species in tropical forests. At adult stages, the effect of pollinators and pre-dispersal fruit predators are often dependent on the density or abundance of flowers and fruit in the canopy, but each have opposite effects on individual realized reproduction. We studied the effect of density on total and mature fruit set and pre-dispersal predation rates within individual tree canopies in a common canopy tree species, Jacaranda copaia in a 50-ha forest census plot in central Panama. We sampled all reproductive sized trees in the plot (n = 188) across three years and estimated fruit set and predation rates. Population-wide pre-dispersal seed predation averaged between 6\textendash{}37\% across years. Using linear mixed effects models, we found that increased density and fecundity of conspecific neighbours increased focal tree fruit set, but also the rate of pre-dispersal predation. An interaction between individual and neighbourhood fruit production predicted lower predation rates at high individual and neighbourhood fecundities, which suggests predator satiation at high fruit abundance levels. However, the rate at which fruit set increased with conspecific neighbour fruit production was greater than the rate at which fruit were lost to predation, resulting in an overall positive effect of neighbour density on mature fruit production in focal trees. Our results run counter to the expectation of a uniformly negative effect of density across all life stages in tropical trees and suggest further exploration of the role of spatial clumping, pollen dispersal limitation, and predation at pre-dispersal adult stages in maintenance of species diversity in plant communities.},

Multiple pollinator probes to a flower may increase both the quantity and genetic diversity of progeny, especially if single probes deposit insufficient pollen for maximal seed set or if the interval between probes is brief. When pollen carryover is limited, sequential pollen loads may also differ markedly in sire representation. We hypothesized that these conditions help explain high levels of multiple paternity in Mimulus ringens fruits. We documented all bee visits to individual flowers, quantified resulting seed set, and determined paternity for 20 seeds per fruit. Most (76\%) flowers received multiple probes, and the interval between probes was usually {$<$}30 min. Flowers probed multiple times produced 44\% more seeds than flowers probed once. All fruits were multiply sired. Flowers receiving a single probe averaged 3.12 outcross sires per fruit, indicating that single probes deposit pollen from several donors. Multiple paternity was even greater after three or more probes (4.92 outcross sires), demonstrating that sequential visits bring pollen from donors not represented in the initial probe.},

The extent and distribution of larval seed predation was examined in nine Yucca species in the southwestern United States. The proportion of seeds destroyed by the yucca moth ranged from 3 \% in Y. schidigera from coastal southern California to 45 \% in one population of Y. angustissima from southern Utah. This sampling was done in 1979 at which time the Y. schidigera population averaged 0.6 larvae per fruit and the population of Y. angustissima averaged 9.3 larvae per fruit. A second sampling of these populations in 1982 averaged 0.5 for Y. schidigera and 5.6 for Y. angustissima. Several species showed significant differences between populations in the number of larvae per fruit. Contrary to expectation, based on the dogma that fruit production is dependent upon Tegeticula pollination (which is always followed by oviposition), a large number of fruits were found without larvae. The proportion varied greatly between populations but was as high as two thirds of all fruits in some populations. Observations suggested that these flowers had been pollinated by Tegeticula and the moths had oviposited in them but that the eggs failed to hatch.},

Before 1987, the two main theories were resource matching (i.e. plants vary their reproductive output to match variable resources) and predator satiation (i.e. losses to predators are reduced by varying the seed crop). Today, resource matching is restricted to a proximate role, and predator satiation is only one of many theories for the ultimate advantage of masting. Wind pollination, prediction of favourable years for seedling establishment, animal pollination, animal dispersal of fruits, high accessory costs of reproduction and large seed size have all been advanced as possible causes of masting. Of these, wind pollination, predator satiation and environmental prediction are important in a number of species, but the other theories have less support. In future, Important advances seem likely from quantifying synchrony within a population, and examining species with very constant reproduction between years.},

  abstract = {Pre-dispersal seed predation may have important effects on population dynamics and trait evolution in plants. In this review, we first present a conceptual framework of the strength of pre-dispersal seed predation and its variation in space and time. We consider the interaction between plants and their seed predators to be ``strong'' when it affects plant population dynamics or causes changes in plant trait\textendash{}fitness relationships, and ``weak'' when it has no such effects, and propose ways of how to adequately assess these effects. Second, we review the ecological literature between 1991 and 2005 to evaluate documented effects of pre-dispersal seed predation on plants and draw five major conclusions. (1) Pre-dispersal seed predation rates are usually low but sometimes high, and show a considerable variation in space and time. (2) Direct evidence suggests that pre-dispersal seed predation can have a significant effect on recruitment and plant population growth rate. Accumulating evidence of seed-limited recruitment suggests that such effects are common. (3) Pre-dispersal seed predation affects selection on several plant traits, such as flowering phenology and flower number, which are usually interpreted mainly in the context of plant\textendash{}pollinator interactions. (4) The patterns of variation in the interactions between plants and pre-dispersal seed predators suggest that geographic selection mosaics may be common. (5) Although there are numerous studies estimating seed predation, there are still rather few studies that have aimed at examining the interaction explicitly in terms of effects on plant population dynamics and trait selection. From these we know that seed predators can have important, and often variable, effects on plant population dynamics and trait evolution. However, it still remains to assess how important they are across study systems and relative to other aspects of the plant's biotic and abiotic environment.},

We examined the co-occurrence patterns of over 1100 tree species in a 25-hectare Amazonian forest plot in relation to field-measured functional traits. Using a null model approach, we show that co-occurring trees are often less ecologically similar than a niche-free (neutral) model predicts. Furthermore, we find evidence for processes that simultaneously drive convergence and divergence in key aspects of plant strategy, suggesting that at least two distinct niche-based processes are occurring. Our results show that strategy differentiation among species contributes to the maintenance of diversity in one of the most diverse tropical forests in the world.
Even in a diverse Amazonian forest, trees show particular leaf characteristics that indicate that they are subtly specialized for habitat and growth strategy.

  abstract = {Growing awareness of the role of enemies in plant community dynamics has led to ecologists exploring how plant-enemy interactions change in human-modified systems. Proximity to forest edges was found to weaken the role of two groups of plant enemies-insect herbivores and fungal pathogens-in increasing plant diversity during the seed-to-seedling transition. However, it is less clear whether edge effects similarly compromise the diversifying effects of fungi and insects on established seedlings. We examined this question in a human-modified wet tropical forest in the Western Ghats of southern India. Over an annual cycle of recruitment, in 730 seedling plots (1 x 1 m each) arrayed at distances 0-100 m from the forest edge across 15 locations in a 30 km(2) landscape, we suppressed the activity of fungal pathogens and insect herbivores by applying fungicide and insecticide to soil, seeds, and seedlings in a subset of plots. Suppressing fungi and insects reduced diversity mainly for seedling recruits and not for seedlings that had already established. However, pesticide effects were only apparent at 90-100 m from forest edges. Specifically, in the interior sites, fungi and insect activity increased recruit diversity, which helped maintain local seedling diversity even though diversity of established seedlings declined with annual mortality. By comparison, canopy openness affected neither the diversity of survivors from the initial seedling cohort nor total seedling diversity after an annual cycle of recruitment. Our results indicate that insects and fungi promote diversity more prominently during early seedling establishment rather than through impacts on post-establishment seedling survival. Thus, edge effects can weaken the diversifying effects of plant-insect and plant-fungal interactions during recruitment and thereby modify the seedling template available for the future tree community in human-modified forests.},

  abstract = {Explaining the maintenance of tropical forest diversity under the countervailing forces of drift and competition poses a major challenge to ecological theory. Janzen-Connell effects, in which host-specific natural enemies restrict the recruitment of juveniles near conspecific adults, provide a potential mechanism. Janzen-Connell is strongly supported empirically, but existing theory does not address the stable coexistence of hundreds of species. Here we use high-performance computing and analytical models to demonstrate that tropical forest diversity can be maintained nearly indefinitely in a prolonged state of transient dynamics due to distance-responsive natural enemies. Further, we show that Janzen-Connell effects lead to community regulation of diversity by imposing a diversity-dependent cost to commonness and benefit to rarity. The resulting species-area and rank-abundance relationships are consistent with empirical results. Diversity maintenance over long time spans does not require dispersal from an external metacommunity, speciation, or resource niche partitioning, only a small zone around conspecific adults in which saplings fail to recruit. We conclude that the Janzen-Connell mechanism can explain the maintenance of tropical tree diversity while not precluding the operation of other niche-based mechanisms such as resource partitioning.},

  abstract = {1. The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and assemblage composition. 2. We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and (ii) their host plant specificity. 3. Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of spatial scales. 5. Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to host-parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or consumer species. 6. Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in seed predation rates for plant recruitment. Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding of the ecology of insect seed predator-plant interactions will be valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops. Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of ecological communities more widely.},

If these predictions are realized, climate warming may have a more profound impact on the functioning and diversity of tropical forests than currently anticipated. Although arthropods comprise over two-thirds of terrestrial species, information on their abundance and extinction rates in tropical habitats is severely limited. Here we analyze data on arthropod and insectivore abundances taken between 1976 and 2012 at two midelevation habitats in Puerto Rico's Luquillo rainforest. During this time, mean maximum temperatures have risen by 2.0 \textdegree{}C. Using the same study area and methods employed by Lister in the 1970s, we discovered that the dry weight biomass of arthropods captured in sweep samples had declined 4 to 8 times, and 30 to 60 times in sticky traps. Analysis of long-term data on canopy arthropods and walking sticks taken as part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research program revealed sustained declines in abundance over two decades, as well as negative regressions of abundance on mean maximum temperatures. We also document parallel decreases in Luquillo's insectivorous lizards, frogs, and birds. While El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation influences the abundance of forest arthropods, climate warming is the major driver of reductions in arthropod abundance, indirectly precipitating a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to improve the fertilizer-nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) for a sustainable citrus production where yield, fruit quality, and environment are reconciled. A soil pot experiment was conducted using 5-year-old orange trees (Citrus sinensis cv. Navel Lane Late) to determine the response of NUE to timing of N-fertilizer supply. An equal N rate (50 g tree1) following two seasonal supply distributions was tested: (1) ENS (early supply from March to June of 75\% of the N rate, with the remaining 25\% administered between July and October) and (2) LNS (late supply of the bulk of the N rate with 25\% between March and June and 75\% between July and October). Labeled fertilizer (5 atom\% 15N excess) was applied in order to accurately quantify N uptake, its partitioning among plantsoil compartments and NUE at the end of fruit drop and at fruit maturity. LNS resulted in a significant increase in NUE in both stages (up to 19\% at the end of fruit drop and 9\% at fruit maturity), while also increasing summer/autumn flush development. ENS showed lower fruit abscission, an enhanced final fruit load (up to 45\%), and a more profuse development of spring flush. It is worth mentioning that LNS led to higher 15N content in the majority of the tree storage organs available for next spring growth resumption. The amount of 15N remaining in the soil of ENS trees at the end of the trial, which represented 16\% of the supplied 15N, was 1.5-fold higher than that of LNS trees as a result of the lower NUE of the former. Irrespective of the seasonal distribution of the fertilizer, mean 15N recovery in the soilplant system at the end of the trial was about 71\%. The results clearly confirm that the N seasonal distribution curve affects NUE in young citrus trees and NUE increases when the bulk of supply of the N rate is delayed to the summer months.},

Variation may also result from differences among adult plants, such as nutrient and water availability or the amount of photosynthetic tissue. In a study of Sabal palmetto seed ecology I found high seed size variation both within- and among-palms, and investigated possible factors maintaining this variation. Seed size was positively correlated with the number of leaves on parent palms. Larger seeds produced more vigorous seedlings that had greater leaf length, area, and mass, and greater root mass. Caryobruchus gleditsiae (Bruchidae: Coleoptera), whose larvae develop within palm seeds, preferentially oviposited on larger seeds, which in turn produced larger beetle offspring. By choosing the largest seeds available, ovipositing beetles thus affect both the quantity and the quality of seeds available for recruitment. I conclude that because beetle predation selects against large seeds, while larger seeds promote seedling vigor, the maintenance of seed size variation may be an adaptation of S. palmetto promoting both seed escape from predators and seedling vigor.},

  abstract = {Aim We set out to test the hypothesis that rates of pre- and post-dispersal seed predation would be higher towards the tropics, across a broad range of species from around the world. We also aimed to quantify the slope and predictive power of the relationship between seed mass and latitude both within and across species. Methods Seed mass, pre-dispersal seed predation and post-dispersal seed removal data were compiled from the literature. Wherever possible, these data were combined with information regarding the latitude at which the data were collected. Analyses were performed using both cross-species and phylogenetic regressions. Results Contrary to expectations, we found no significant relationship between seed predation and latitude (log10 proportion of seeds surviving predispersal seed predation vs. latitude, P = 0.63; R2 = 0.02; n = 122 species: log10 proportion of seeds remaining after postdispersal seed removal vs. latitude, P = 0.54; R2 = 0.02; n = 205 species). These relationships remained non-significant after variation because of seed mass was accounted for. We also found a very substantial (R2 = 0.21) relationship between seed mass and latitude across 2706 species, with seed mass being significantly higher towards the tropics. Within-species seed mass decline with latitude was significant, but only about two-sevenths, as rapid as the cross-species decline with latitude. Results of phylogenetic analyses were very similar to cross-species analyses. We also demonstrated a positive relationship between seed mass and development time across ten species from dry sclerophyll woodland in Sydney (P {$<$} 0.001; R2 = 0.77; Standardized Major Axis slope = 0.14). These data lend support to the hypothesis that growing period might affect the maximum attainable seed mass in a given environment. Main conclusions There was no evidence that seed predation is higher towards the tropics. The strong relationship between seed mass and latitude shown here had been observed in previous studies, but had not previously been quantified at a global scale. There was a tenfold reduction in mean seed mass for every c. 23\textdegree{} moved towards the poles, despite a wide range of seed mass within each latitude.},

These species came from an arid environment, a subalpine environment, and a temperate coastal environment. We also gathered data from the published literature (global) on survivorship through postdispersal seed predation for 280 species and survivorship through predispersal seed predation for 174 species. We found a weak positive correlation between seed mass and the percentage of seeds remaining after 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed predators at two of three field sites in Australia, and no significant relationship across 280 species from the global literature, or at the remaining field site. There was no significant relationship between seed mass and survivorship through predispersal seed predation either cross-species or across phylogenetic divergences in any of the vegetation types, or in the compilation of data from the literature. Postdispersal seed removal was responsible for a greater percentage of seed loss in our field studies than was predispersal seed predation. On average, 83\% of diaspores remained after 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed removers, whereas 87\% of seeds survived all predispersal seed predation that occurred between seed formation and seed maturity. Mean seed survival was higher in the field studies than in the literature compilations, and species showing 100\% survival were heavily underrepresented in the literature. These differences may be due to biases in species selection or publication bias. Seed defensive tissue mass increased isometrically with seed mass, but there was no significant relationship between the amount of defensive tissue per gram of seed reserve mass and survivorship through postdispersal seed predation.},

  abstract = {A study on seed predation by bruchid beetles was carried out to understand the interactions between seed beetles and Acacia seeds in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. The beetles encountered in seeds were carefully isolated, preserved, labelled and identified. Seed infestation was assessed using cutting tests. Four seed beetles, Enaretha castelnaudi, Tuberculobruchus natalensis and Bruchidius spp. were found in two large seeds of Acacia sieberiana, while Caryedon serratus and Bruchidius submaculatus were found in small seeds of Acacia gerrardii. The small seeded A. gerrardii had a higher rate of infestation than the large seeded A. sieberiana, in spite of the latter species having more seed predators than the former. The intensity of seed predation on A. sieberiana had negligible differences within and between study sites. The intensity of seed predation was only significant with A. gerrardii at Kayampara study site. The possible compensatory response by A. sieberiana to seed predation by beetles is possession of many large seeds with adequate resources to accommodate a guild of seed predators. This study indicated the potential of seed predation as a biological control tool against the spread of A. gerrardii.

  abstract = {1. Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at random from the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2. Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3. We found that under a Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution, Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's {$\lambda$} performed well and substantially better than Moran's I and Blomberg's K. Pagel's {$\lambda$} provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheif's Cmean. Blomberg's K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4. Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5. We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6. These guidelines aim to better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it from random trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades.},

Direct observations of seed survival patterns and bagging experiments using two sizes of mesh (cloth and wire) in the canopy of Dryobalanops aromatica identified insects as the principal seed predators during both the last phase, and overall.

  abstract = {Studies of host specificity in tropical insect herbivores are evolving from a focus on insect distribution data obtained by canopy fogging and other mass collecting methods, to a focus on obtaining data on insect rearing and experimentally verified feeding patterns. We review this transition and identify persisting methodological problems. Replicated quantitative surveys of plant\textendash{}herbivore food webs, based on sampling efforts of an order of magnitude greater than is customary at present, may be cost-effectively achieved by small research teams supported by local assistants. Survey designs that separate historical and ecological determinants of host specificity by studying herbivores feeding on the same plant species exposed to different environmental or experimental conditions are rare. Further, we advocate the use of host-specificity measures based on plant phylogeny. Existing data suggest that a minority of species in herbivore communities feed on a single plant species when alternative congeneric hosts are available. Thus, host plant range limits tend to coincide with those of plant genera, rather than species or suprageneric taxa. Host specificity among tropical herbivore guilds decreases in the sequence: granivores{$>$}leaf-miners{$>$}fructivores{$>$}leaf-chewers=sap-suckers{$>$}xylophages{$>$}root-feeders, thus paralleling patterns observed in temperate forests. Differences in host specificity between temperate and tropical forests are difficult to assess since data on tropical herbivores originate from recent field studies, whereas their temperate counterparts derive from regional host species lists, assembled over many years. No major increase in host specificity from temperate to tropical communities is evident. This conclusion, together with the recent downward revisions of extremely high estimates of tropical species richness, suggest that tropical ecosystems may not be as biodiverse as previously thought.},

It is difficult to answer definitively because we have so many (at least 120) plausible hypotheses. This abundance of hypotheses has led to a number of attempts to classify them. Unfortunately, richness hypotheses often defy such categorization. Instead of placing species richness hypotheses into categories, I suggest an alternative approach: to treat species richness hypotheses as violations of the assumptions of Gause's Competitive Exclusion Principle. This is a very similar approach to the pedagogy of population genetics: evolution occurs if and only if at least one assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg principle is violated. The classification of hypotheses advocated here treats interspecific competition as a central organizing concept in community theory. However, it does not treat competition as an organizing concept in communities: indeed, the relaxation or disruption of competition is considered to be the status quo in the majority of communities.},

Insect oral secretions are important for the induction of a number of plant responses, but the relative role of mechanical damage in the induction of these responses is often not well understood. Damage from the frugivore Heliothis subflexa, a specialist on Physalis species, causes herbivore-induced fruit abscission. In this field study, we examined the separate and combined effects of mechanical damage and H. subflexa oral secretions on Physalis fruit abscission. 2. To determine the relative role of mechanical and chemical factors, the following treatments were administered to fruit: (1) three levels of mechanical damage, (2) natural herbivore damage by control larvae and by larvae surgically treated to inhibit saliva secretion, and (3) injection of H. subflexa oral secretions and a water control. Abscission of mechanically damaged fruit with and without the addition of oral secretions was also compared. 3. Mechanical damage was sufficient to cause fruit abscission, and the addition of oral secretions to mechanically damaged fruit did not cause an increase in fruit abscission. Normal caterpillars and those treated to inhibit saliva secretion caused similar abscission rates. 4. Though most studies examining the effects of insect oral secretions on induced plant responses find these chemical stimuli to be important or essential, the results of the present study showed that oral secretions are not necessary for fruit abscission. Future work is needed to determine the relative importance of mechanical damage in herbivore-induced plant responses in other systems.},

Plants faced with drought, or simply not quite enough water, may be more likely to drop their fruit prematurely. Reichardt et al. found that a small signaling peptide hormone, phytosulfokine, which was previously known for its ability to regulate plant cell growth, also drives fruit abscission. Processed, and thus activated, by a subtilisin-like protease, phytosulfokine in turn drives expression of the hydrolases that degrade the cell walls in the abscission zone, leading to dropped fruit.
Science, this issue p. 1482
The premature abscission of flowers and fruits limits crop yield under environmental stress. Drought-induced flower drop in tomato plants was found to be regulated by phytosulfokine (PSK), a peptide hormone previously known for its growth-promoting and immune-modulating activities. PSK formation in response to drought stress depends on phytaspase 2, a subtilisin-like protease of the phytaspase subtype that generates the peptide hormone by aspartate-specific processing of the PSK precursor in the tomato flower pedicel. The mature peptide acts in the abscission zone where it induces expression of cell wall hydrolases that execute the abscission process. Our results provide insight into the molecular control of abscission as regulated by proteolytic processing to generate a small plant peptide hormone.
A protease processes the peptide signal that drives water-deprived tomato plants to jettison their flowers and fruit.

  abstract = {In this paper I seek an explanation for the low level of seed predation recorded for many plant species adapted for ant dispersal by examining the mechanical defense properties of seeds. Mechanical defense of 115 plant species, in the form of seed strength, was measured using two techniques, a Universal Force Tester and pressure applied with forceps. Most species tested had relatively strong seeds ({$>$}20 N), though a significant minority had relatively weak seeds. Preliminary findings of contrasts across independent phylogenetic divergences suggest there was no consistent tendency for seed strength to be greater in species adapted for ant dispersal compared to their relatives that are not. In seed removal assays performed in the field, weaker seeds were more likely to be removed than stronger seeds, whether elaiosomes were present or not. Weaker seeds were also more likely to be eaten than stronger seeds. In laboratory seed predation assays, strong seeds were rarely eaten by two common seed-removing ant species (Rhytidoponera metallica and Pheidole sp. 4). In contrast, species with relatively weak seeds experienced much higher levels of seed predation, up to 100\%. In conclusion, the majority of species adapted for ant dispersal produce relatively strong seeds, and this may explain the low level of predation recorded for these species.},

Understanding how habitat heterogeneity influences the causal factors that limit propagule establishment in natural populations is central to assess these demographic bottlenecks and their consequences. Bamboos often influence forest structure and dynamics and are a major factor in generating landscape complexity and habitat heterogeneity in tropical forests. To understand how patch heterogeneity influences plant recruitment we studied critical establishment stages during early recruitment of Euterpe edulis, Sloanea guianensis and Virola bicuhyba in bamboo and non-bamboo stands in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We combined observational studies of seed rain and seedling emergence with seed addition experiments to evaluate the transition probabilities among regeneration stages within bamboo and non-bamboo stands. The relative importance of each mortality factor was evaluated by determining how the loss of propagules affected stage-specific recruitment success. Our results revealed that the seed addition treatment significantly increased seedling survivorship for all three species. E. edulis seedling survival probability increased in the addition treatment in the two stand types. However, for S. guianensis and V. bicuhyba this effect depended strongly on artificially protecting the seeds, as both species experienced increased seed and seedling losses due to post-dispersal seed predators and herbivores. Propagules of all three species had a greater probability of reaching subsequent recruitment stages when protected. The recruitment of large-seeded V. bicuhyba and E. edulis appears to be much more limited by post-dispersal factors than by dispersal limitation, whereas the small-seeded S. guianensis showed an even stronger effect of post-dispersal factors causing recruitment collapse in some situations. We demonstrated that E. edulis, S. guianensis and V. bicuhyba are especially susceptible to predation during early compared with later establishment stages and this early stage mortality can be more crucial than stand differences as determinants of successful regeneration. Among-species differences in the relative importance of dispersal vs. establishment limitation are mediated by variability in species responses to patch heterogeneity. Thus, bamboo effects on the early recruitment of non-bamboo species are patchy and species-specific, with successional bamboo patches exerting a far-reaching influence on the heterogeneity of plant species composition and abundance.},

Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40\% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

            There is growing realization that intraspecific variation in seed dispersal can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. However, we do not have a good understanding of the drivers or causes of intraspecific variation in dispersal, how strong an effect these drivers have, and how widespread they are across dispersal modes. As a first step to developing a better understanding, we present a broad, but not exhaustive, review of what is known about the drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal, and what remains uncertain. We start by decomposing ``drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal'' into intrinsic drivers (i.e. variation in traits of individual plants) and extrinsic drivers (i.e. variation in ecological context). For intrinsic traits, we further decompose intraspecific variation into variation among individuals and variation of trait values within individuals. We then review our understanding of the major intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of intraspecific variation in seed dispersal, with an emphasis on variation among individuals. Crop size is the best supported and best understood intrinsic driver of variation across dispersal modes; overall, more seeds are dispersed as more seeds are produced, even in cases where per seed dispersal rates decline. Fruit/seed size is the second most widely studied intrinsic driver, and is also relevant to a broad range of seed dispersal modes. Remaining intrinsic drivers are poorly understood, and range from effects that are probably widespread, such as plant height, to drivers that are most likely sporadic, such as fruit or seed color polymorphism. Primary extrinsic drivers of variation in seed dispersal include local environmental conditions and habitat structure. Finally, we present a selection of outstanding questions as a starting point to advance our understanding of individual variation in seed dispersal.},

We employ a simulation model to examine the effect of enemy host breadth on plant species richness and defence community structure, and to assess expected diversity maintenance in example systems. Only models in which plant enemy similarity declines rapidly with defence similarity support greater species richness than models of neutral drift. In contrast, a wide range of enemy host breadths result in spatial dispersion of defence traits, at both landscape and local scales, indicating that enemy-mediated competition may increase defence-trait diversity without enhancing species richness. Nevertheless, insect and pathogen host associations in Panama and Papua New Guinea demonstrate a potential to enhance plant species richness and defence-trait diversity comparable to strictly specialised enemies.},

  abstract = {To investigate synchronized annual fluctuation of seed production and its advantage for regeneration at the community level, for nine years (1987\textendash{}1995) we monitored the flowering, seed production, and seedling emergence of the 16 principal tree species in a temperate deciduous forest, Ogawa Forest Reserve, in central Japan. We found that the species with higher synchronized flowering within a population had larger fluctuation of annual seed production at the population level. The coefficient of concordance of flowering and the coefficient of variation of annual seed production were continuously distributed among species, making it difficult to distinguish masting from nonmasting species. The annual seed production patterns of the 16 species were classified, by cluster analysis, into groups that synchronize their fluctuation of annual seed production. This analysis showed a highly synchronized annual seed production, not only among congeneric species, but also among species of different families. Although our results have some insufficiency of statistical significance, they did show that predator satiation, both in a population and a guild, effectively operated for many species to enhance seed survival at the pre-dispersal stage. They also showed that pollination efficiency was likely to be operating at the population level for half of the wind-pollinating species. However, generalist predator satiation at the postdispersal seed stage may not operate in a simple, detectable manner in this species-rich forest community. It is highly probable that there are combined effects of several factors: limited weather triggers for flowering, common flowering physiology among taxonomically related species, and the ecological advantages at the population and guild levels, may cause multiple species to have synchronized fluctuation patterns of seed production.},

Ecological factors that influence seed colonization are not well understood yet are fundamental to the interactions between soilborne fungi and seeds that ultimately influence plant demography and community structure. Here we present current perspectives on seed defense syndromes and related frameworks for predicting colonization success of fungi, with a focus on seeds of tropical pioneer trees. We present a case study that tests whether fungal host range can be predicted by field observations of host use, seed defense syndromes, or phylogenetic relatedness of fungi or hosts. We show that phylogenetic relatedness of hosts, but not fungi, is a strong predictor of fungal colonization of seeds. We posit that the impacts of individual fungi and microbial consortia on seed viability and germination may in turn reflect fungal interactions with the suites of plant defenses codified recently under the broad framework of seed dormancy-defense syndromes. Our findings set the stage for experiments that track colonization, germination, and seedling establishment in the field, important for understanding impacts of fungi on the recruitment of tropical trees.},

Many empirical studies have investigated whether predators are distance-responsive; however, few studies have examined whether distance-responsiveness matters for how predators maintain tree diversity. Using a site-occupancy model, we show analytically that distance-responsive predators are actually less able to maintain diversity than specialist predators that are not distance-responsive. Generally, specialist predators maintain diversity because they become rare when their host's densities are low, reducing predation risk. However, if predators are distance-responsive, and most seeds cannot disperse away from these predators, then seed predation rates will remain high, even if predator density is low across the landscape. Consequently, a reduction in a host's population density may not lead to a significant reduction in seed and seedling predation. We show that habitat partitioning can cause recruitment to be highest near conspecific adults, even in the presence of distance-responsive predators, without any change in the effect that the predators have on coexistence (a result contrary to predictions of the Janzen\textendash{}Connell hypothesis). Rather, specialist predators and habitat partitioning have additive effects on species coexistence in our model, i.e., neither mechanism alters the effect of the other one.},

  abstract = {The study of biodiversity has tended to focus primarily on relatively information-poor measures of species diversity. Recently, many studies of local diversity (alpha diversity) have begun to use measures of functional and phylogenetic alpha diversity. Investigations into the phylogenetic and functional dissimilarity (beta diversity) of communities have been far less numerous, but these dissimilarity measures have the potential to infer the mechanisms underlying community assembly and dynamics. Here, we relate levels of phylogenetic and functional alpha diversity to levels of phylogenetic and functional beta diversity to infer the mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the assembly of tree communities in six forests located in tropical and temperate latitudes. The results show that abiotic filtering plays a role in structuring local assemblages and governing spatial turnover in community composition and that phylogenetic measures of alpha and beta diversity are not strong predictors of functional alpha and beta diversity in the forests studied.},

Golden Delicious trees, exposed to spring frost, showed the occurrence of seeds with white (W), spotted (S) and black (B) integuments, with a different distribution, amount and damage in shedding and non-shedding fruits at several times after anthesis. While B seeds were completely degenerated, the S seeds showed hystological and cytochemical features that included a precocious embryo development stage, an embryonal cells shrinkage, an absence of reserves in the suspensor, endosperm and integuments, and a probable block of the routing of reserves, as a consequence of spring frost damages. All these features are the same occurring in seeds undergoing to natural abscission phenomenon and in the W seeds of shedding fruits observed in previous years. The S seeds damage is certainly attributable to meteorological events, because the S seeds were never found until the occurrence of the spring frosts. On the contrary, the damage in the W seeds, which do not show external symptoms in shedding fruits, may be due on the one hand to meteorological stress, and on the other hand to endogenous stress caused by natural abscission process. At 60 days post anthesis, at the end of fruit-set, the ripening fruits show a mean number of five well developed W seeds in normal cytohistological conditions. The data are discussed in relation to the general problem of natural abscission of immature fruits.},

In addition, non-fatal damage by seed predators may allow infection by fungi responsible for post-dispersal seed losses. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify pre-dispersal seed predation and fungal infection in a Neotropical tree species, Luehea seemannii, that produces dehiscent fruits and wind-dispersed seeds, and (2) to link pre-dispersal effects on seed quality to seed survival in the soil. To examine how seed predators and fungi influence seed losses, mesh exclosures, fungicide, and the combination of both treatments were applied to separate branches in the canopy of trees in Gamboa and Parque Natural Metropolitano (PNM), Panama. To determine if treatments affect seed viability and survival in the soil, half of the seeds collected from each treatment were buried for 4 weeks in forest soils and subsequently allowed to germinate before and after the breaking of dormancy. Overall, 24 percent of developing fruit were lost to insect attack. In contrast, fungi infected only 3 percent of seeds at the pre-dispersal stage. For seeds germinated directly after collection, fungicide significantly increased germination in the wetter site (Gamboa) but decreased germination in the drier site (PNM). The pre-dispersal insect exclosure treatment increased the fraction of seeds that remained dormant after burial in the soil. This result suggests that exposure to insect predators may cause physical damage to seeds that results in the loss of physical dormancy but does not necessarily increase the susceptibility of seeds to pathogen attack in the soil.},

However, the continuously flowering shrub Dillenia suffruticosa (Dilleniaceae) is often infested by fruit predators and occasionally produces fruits where mature seeds are absent. These reproductive features may support an alternative hypothesis for excess production of reproductive organs: the reproductive assurance hypothesis. We marked 1190 reproductive organs in 180 inflorescences of 41 plant individuals and examined the relationships among the reproductive organ features and the effects of both climate and predators. During the flower budding stage, the fate of reproductive organs was primary climate-induced. The percentage of flower/fruit abscission increased as the cumulative temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) decreased and the cumulative precipitation increased, supporting the resource boom hypothesis. Insect predation was the most common fate of immature fruits. As PAR increased, the prevalence of insect predation and production of mature seed increased. At a reduced PAR, the production of fruits with many immature seeds could serve as compensatory reproductive organs for insect predators, consistent with the reproductive assurance hypothesis. The excess production of reproductive organs might be a result of adaptation to climate fluctuations in the South-East Asian tropics.},

The hypothesis is tested that N. shoreae populations are maintained between mass-fruiting events by recruitment during sporadic fruiting. A record of flowering among 143 dipterocarps of 27 species is reported in Pasoh Forest Reserve, West Malaysia from May 1985 to July 1987. A quantitative analysis of N. shoreae pre-imaginal survival is described in one of the five sporadic flowering events that occurred. The primary mortality factors were abscission of fruit containing eggs and consumption by vertebrates of fruit containing pupae and third instar larvae. Overall the percentage of N. shoreae eggs that developed to produce adult weevils varied from 0 to 1.8\%. This survival is low compared with that of other fruit predators. Thus, sporadic fruiting does not greatly boost N. shoreae populations between mass-flowering events and the key to the survival of this weevil lies elsewhere. The implications of this low recruitment for the evolution of mass flowering are discussed.},

  abstract = {We define seed limitation to be an increase in population size following seed addition. Here, we briefly consider how theoretical models deal with seed limitation and how seed sowing experiments can be used to unravel the extent of seed limitation in natural systems. We review two types of seed addition experiments: seed augmentation studies where seeds are added to existing populations; and seed introductions where seeds are sown in unoccupied sites. Overall, approximately 50\% of seed augmentation experiments show evidence of seed limitation. These studies show that seed limitation tends to occur more commonly in early successional habitats and in early successional species. Most of the studies have concentrated on simply categorising populations as seed- or microsite-limited, but we believe that seed sowing experiments could be used to reveal much more about community structure, and we discuss possible future directions. In 53\% of introduction studies (where seeds were sown at sites from which the species was known to be absent) the introduced species was recorded in at least one of the experimental sites following sowing. However, of the subset of studies where both seedlings and adult plants were recorded, 64\% of sites contained seedlings while only 23\% contained adults. This implies that, for many species, conditions for establishment are more stringent than conditions for germination. The successful establishment of plants in unoccupied patches indicates the potential for immigration to enhance local diversity (the spatial mass effect). Few studies continued monitoring for long enough to determine whether or not self-sustaining populations were successfully established, and no study attempted to link introduction sites to a putative natural source of propagules, or considered the dynamics of the metapopulation as a whole.},

Numerous natural systems have the prerequisites for the storage effect, yet it has rarely been quantitatively assessed. Here, we investigate the possible importance of the storage effect in explaining the coexistence of tree species in the diverse tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. This tropical forest has been monitored for more than 20 years, and annual seed production is asynchronous among species, a primary requirement for the storage effect. We constructed a model of forest regeneration that includes species-specific recruitment through seed, sapling, and adult stages, and we parameterized the model using data for 28 species for which information is known about seedling germination and survival. Simulations of the model demonstrated that the storage effect alone can be a strong mechanism allowing long-term persistence of species. We also developed a metric to quantify the strength of the storage effect in a way comparable to classical resource partitioning. Applying this metric to seed production data from 108 species, the storage effect reduces the strength of pairwise interspecific competition to 11\textendash{}43\% of the strength of intraspecific competition, thereby demonstrating strong potential to facilitate coexistence. Finally, for a subset of 51 species whose phylogenetic relationships are known, we compared the strength of the storage effect between pairs of species to their phylogenetic similarity. The strength of the storage effect between closely related species was on average no different from distantly related species, implying that the storage effect can be important in promoting the coexistence of even closely related species.},

Multiple studies have linked plant species' demographic rates to commonly measured traits. However, predictive power is usually low \textendash{} raising questions about the practical usefulness of traits \textendash{} and analyses have been limited to size-independent univariate approaches restricted to a particular life stage. Here we directly evaluated the predictive power of multiple traits simultaneously across the entire life cycle of 136 tropical tree species from central Panama. Using a model-averaging approach, we related wood density, seed mass, leaf mass per area and adult stature (maximum diameter) to onset of reproduction, seed production, seedling establishment, and growth and survival at seedling, sapling and adult stages. Three of the four traits analysed here (wood density, seed mass and adult stature) typically explained 20\textendash{}60\% of interspecific variation at a given vital rate and life stage. There were strong shifts in the importance of different traits throughout the life cycle of trees, with seed mass and adult stature being most important early in life, and wood density becoming most important after establishment. Every trait had opposing effects on different vital rates or at different life stages; for example, seed mass was associated with higher seedling establishment and lower initial survival, wood density with higher survival and lower growth, and adult stature with decreased juvenile but increased adult growth and survival. Forest dynamics are driven by the combined effects of all demographic processes across the full life cycle. Application of a multitrait and full-life cycle approach revealed the full role of key traits, and illuminated how trait effects on demography change through the life cycle. The effects of traits on one life stage or vital rate were sometimes offset by opposing effects at another stage, revealing the danger of drawing broad conclusions about functional trait\textendash{}demography relationships from analysis of a single life stage or vital rate. Robust ecological and evolutionary conclusions about the roles of functional traits rely on an understanding of the relationships of traits to vital rates across all life stages.},

schedules for perennial plants using studies either directly quantifying
RA or that collected data from
which the shape of an RA schedule

which variation in RA may arise.
We identified 34 studies from which aspects of an RA schedule could be inferred. Within those, RA schedules varied considerably across
species: some species abruptly shift all resources from growth to reproduction; most
others gradually shift resources into reproduction, but under a variety of graded
schedules. Available data indicate the maximum fraction of energy allocated to
production ranges from 0.1 to 1 and that shorter lived species tend to have higher
initial RA and increase their
RA more quickly than do
longer-lived species. Overall, our findings indicate, little data exist about
RA schedules in perennial
plants. Available data suggest a wide range of schedules across species. Collection
of more data on RA schedules

Despite the proposed importance of microorganisms in maintaining rainforest diversity, few studies have investigated soil community dynamics in relation to non-random mortality processes. A mechanistic understanding of microbial processes that help create rainforest diversity is critical for the conservation of these ecosystems. This study investigated microbial community dynamics that may underpin distance- and density-dependent mortality in the long-term forest dynamics plot, Davies Creek, in tropical Far North Queensland using community fingerprinting. We hypothesized that: (1) microbial involvement in distance-dependent seedling mortality would result in an increase in community similarity or the presence of predictor OTUs in conspecific adult tree rhizospheres, relative to physically nearby heterospecifics; (2) on average, plant species identified as having a history of distance dependent seedling mortality would exhibit more similar microbial communities among their conspecific individuals, than those that did not; and (3) dense patches of conspecific seedlings would promote the assembly of distinct soil microbial communities, which may be involved in density-dependent seedling mortality. We found no evidence of rhizosphere community similarity amongst adult plant rhizospheres. However, the presence of densely germinating seedlings altered the soil communities relative to seedling-sparse soils, enriching different OTUs depending on the patch location.},

Intuitively, more variable annual seedfall causes the representative seed to experience a greater density of conspecific seeds and suffer greater density-dependent effects. This handicap must be overcome for the per seed probability of recruitment to be greater in years with greater seed production. We quantified spatial and annual variation in seedfall and seedling recruitment, evaluated density dependence and economies of scale during the seed-to-seedling transition, and investigated the synergistic consequences of density dependence and variable annual seedfall for seedling recruitment on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Weekly censuses of 200 0.5-m2 seed traps documented seedfall for 15 years and 108 plant species. Annual censuses of 600 1-m2 seedling plots documented recruitment for nine years and 32 species. The density of seedling recruits tended to increase with the density of seeds; however, the per seed probability of recruitment invariably decreased with seedfall density. Negative density dependence characterized the seed-to-seedling transition. Observed levels of spatial and interannual variation in seedfall density would reduce long-term recruitment by up to 28\% if negatively density-dependent survival acted identically across years; however, the strength of negative density dependence varied significantly among years for 12 of 32 species. Negative density dependence occurred in all years for these species but was significantly weaker during the one or two years of greatest seedfall than during the remaining years of lower seedfall. The per seed probability of recruitment increased significantly with annual seedfall for eight of these species. These eight species realized postdispersal economies of scale despite the reduction in long-term recruitment expected from the synergism between variable annual seed production and negatively density-dependent seed fate.},

  abstract = {In closed-canopy forests, plant morphology and physiology determine shade tolerance and potential growth and mortality rates; potential vital rates and ongoing gap dependence determine realized vital rates; and realized vital rates determine individual size distributions. This hypothesis was evaluated for the 73 most abundant canopy tree species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The percentage of recruits located in tree-fall gaps (P), sapling growth (G), and mortality (M) rates, and the coefficient of skewness of size distributions (g(1)) were determined from censuses of all individuals {$>$}10 mm dbh in a 50-ha plot, Seven qualitative, bivariate predictions relating g(1), G, M, P, and wood density (W) were evaluated. Six of the seven predictions were substantiated in pairwise analyses. A path analysis integrated all seven predictions and explained 51\% of the interspecific variation in g,. Size distributions with many large individuals and a long tail of relatively rare, small individuals (g(1) {$<$} 0) characterized gap-dependent species with large fecundity, seed mortality, seedling mortality, G, M, and P. Size distributions with many small individuals and a long tail of relatively rare, large individuals (g(1) {$>$} 0) characterized shade-tolerant species with the opposite traits. The percentage of tropical tree species that require tree-fall gaps to regenerate has been estimated to range from {$<$}20\% to {$>$}70\% for old-growth forests. Our analyses suggest that there are not large numbers of functionally equivalent species at either extreme of the regeneration continuum. Rather, there are very few extremely shade-tolerant and extremely light-demanding species. Most species have intermediate light requirements and lifestyles.},

Niche differences are evident from non-random spatial distributions along micro-topographic gradients and from a survivorship-growth tradeoff during regeneration. Host-specific pests reduce recruitment near reproductive adults (the Janzen-Connell effect), and, negative density dependence occurs over larger spatial scales among the more abundant species and may regulate their populations. A fourth hypothesis, that suppressed understory plants rarely come into competition with one another, has not been considered before and has profound implications for species coexistence. These hypotheses are mutually compatible. Infrequent competition among suppressed understory plants, niche differences, and Janzen-Connell effects may facilitate the coexistence of the many rare plant species found in tropical forests while negative density dependence regulates the few most successful and abundant species.},

  abstract = {Cutting off carbohydrate supply to longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) fruit by girdling and defoliation or by detachment induced 100\% abscission within a few days. We used these treatments to study the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fruit abscission. Girdling plus defoliation decreased sugar concentrations in the fruit and pedicel and depleted starch grains in the chloroplasts in the cells of abscission zone. Prior to the occurrence of intensive fruit abscission, there was a burst in ROS in the pedicel, which peaked at 1 day after treatment (DAT), when H2O2 in the abscission zone was found to be chiefly located along the plasma membrane (PM). H2O2 was found exclusively in the cell walls 2 DAT, almost disappeared 3 DAT, and reappeared in the mitochondria and cell walls 4 DAT. Signs of cell death such as cytoplasm breakdown were apparent from 3 DAT. The burst of ROS coincided with a sharp increase in the activity of PM-bound NADPH oxidase in the pedicel. At the same time, activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and peroxidase (POD) were all increased by the treatment and maintained higher than those in the control. Accompanying the reduction in H2O2 abundance, there was a sharp decrease in PM-bound NADPH oxidase activity after 1 DAT in the treated fruit. H2O2 scavenger dimethylthiourea (DMTU, 1 g L-1) significantly inhibited fruit abscission in detached fruit clusters and suppressed the increase in cellulase activity in the abscission zone. These results suggest that fruit abscission induced by carbohydrate stress is mediated by ROS. Roles of ROS in regulating fruit abscission were discussed in relation to its subcellular distribution.},

  abstract = {The measurement of fitness is critical to biological research. Although the determination of fitness for some organisms may be relatively straightforward under controlled conditions, it is often a difficult or nearly impossible task in nature. Plants are no exception. The potential for long-distance pollen dispersal, likelihood of multiple reproductive events per inflorescence, varying degrees of reproductive growth in perennials, and asexual reproduction all confound accurate fitness measurements. For these reasons, biomass is frequently used as a proxy for plant fitness. However, the suitability of indirect fitness measurements such as plant size is rarely evaluated. This review outlines the important associations between plant performance, fecundity, and fitness. We make a case for the reliability of biomass as an estimate of fitness when comparing conspecifics of the same age class. We reviewed 170 studies on plant fitness and discuss the metrics commonly employed for fitness estimations. We find that biomass or growth rate are frequently used and often positively associated with fecundity, which in turn suggests greater overall fitness. Our results support the utility of biomass as an appropriate surrogate for fitness under many circumstances, and suggest that additional fitness measures should be reported along with biomass or growth rate whenever possible.},
